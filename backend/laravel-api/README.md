## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Testing

This project uses **Pest 4** as the testing framework. All tests have been migrated from PHPUnit to Pest for a more expressive and modern testing experience.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
composer test

# Run tests with coverage report
composer test-coverage

# Run tests in parallel (faster execution)
composer test-parallel

# Run specific test file
./vendor/bin/pest tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php

# Run tests with filtering
./vendor/bin/pest --filter=authentication
```

### Available Test Commands

- `composer test` - Run all Pest tests
- `composer test-coverage` - Generate coverage report (requires Xdebug or PCOV)
- `composer test-parallel` - Run tests in parallel using multiple processes
- `composer test-shard` - Run tests in sharded mode for CI/CD environments

### Test Structure

- `tests/Unit/` - Unit tests (isolated component tests)
- `tests/Feature/` - Feature tests (integration tests)
- `tests/Feature/Api/` - API endpoint tests
- `tests/Arch/` - Architecture tests (enforcing design rules)

### Writing Tests

Pest uses a function-based syntax that's more expressive than PHPUnit:

```php
it('returns successful response for health check endpoint', function () {
    $response = $this->get('/up');
    $response->assertStatus(200);
});

it('validates user authentication', function () {
    $user = User::factory()->create();

    expect($user->name)->not->toBeEmpty()
        ->and($user->email)->toBeString();
});
```
